Welcome to the Academic Integrity compromisation service!

This section is especially designed for students at Memorial University of Newfoundland who are willing to risk their reputation, pride and 'academic integrity' just to get their hands on some unauthorized and illegal (according to MUN's policies) course materials, i.e. solved assignments, quiz solutions, exam hacking, etc.

If you are a Computer Science major at MUN, you have the experience and knowledge base for investigating into the bowels of this website. We would advise not to, since we reserve the right to track your activities and formally submit your behavorial data anonymously to the university's Head of Department.

Currently there has been a breach spotted at `garfield.cs.mun.ca` for which PDF Sauce will not be held responsible. For privacy and protection reasons, we have temporarily disabled our **MUN Cheater** service.

Please check back soon for updates!
